                    Hello! My name is Kyle!<br /><br />
                    Currently I'm in southeast Michigan, and during the week I make my way out to Detroit to work at Rocket Homes!<br /> 
                    As a Software Engineer there, I'm a full stack developer currently doing Android development.<br /><br />
                    I graduated with my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from Eastern Michigan University!
                    During my time at EMU, I did some pretty cool stuff! I worked for the campus Housing &amp; Residence Life program there as an RA. 
                    I was also apart of Kick and Push Longboarding Club, made the dean's list 6 times, and graduated magna cum laude with a 3.74 cumulative GPA.<br /><br />
                    I've always been very passionate about computers, and I love developing software!
                    I find it really interesting to see how things work together through the entire stack! 
                    I primarily learned Java while at EMU, and I began teaching myself C# and web front-end during my free time prior to graduation.
                    I've since gained lots of experience with TypeScript and Angular, as well as .NET Core and WPF/UWP Development.
                    I've also had some experience developing for Android and iOS, and those were some of my favorite projects while at EMU!
                    Since joining up with the Android team at Rocket Homes, this is what I'm more familiar with in terms of mobile development.  
                    Additionally, I also have some experience developing video games in Unity.<br /><br />
                    If you have any questions, please feel free to email me!

                        Built web applications utilizing Angular, TypeScript, C# .NET Core, and MSSQL to create progressive web apps (PWA).
                        Led Angular front-end development. Built C# .NET Core backend. By developing PWAs for these products, these allowed
                        the apps to perform better on a variety of different devices. Build times were improved, and the apps were able to make
                        use of service workers which allows the apps to be stored on devices for offline use and prompted users to install the
                        apps locally if they liked. Service workers also allowed the Push API to be used so push notifications can be received on 
                        all devices connected to the server.

                        Created C# WPF Applications to be used for setup of systems utilizing the PWAs. These apps allowed users to configure
                        additional features for the web apps without creating errors in the raw JSON files. This allowed systems to be setup
                        with more ease and automation, and reduced the amount of time technicans spend setting up systems.

                        This app wraps a portion of one the Angular apps through Electron to be used as a cross-platform desktop app. The app exports
                        a JSON file which can then be imported into the corresponding Angular app.

                    I have a lot of experience in programming in Java. It's what EMU used for their curriculum, which helped introduce me to a lot of the core concepts and 
                    ideas of computer science. Learning Java first also helped me learn how to develop Android applications and still helps me today as I write in Kotlin!
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I've gotten lot of experience with C#, as it is incredibly similar to Java. Developing REST APIs for the products at Daifuku, we ended up using .NET Core,
                    and .NET Standard for some libraries. For my software capstone at EMU, I worked a team of classmates to create a .NET Framework MVC website for a client
                    which interacted with a MySQL database through C#. I also did get some experience using C# with Unity for a game programming class I took. While at KLA,
                    I got an introduction to C# for Windows Forms Apps, and through my time at Daifuku, I've got even more experience with WPF apps. I ended up architecting
                    a handful of MVVM WPF apps which help set up a few JSON files for our web apps, and perform a couple of quality checking processes.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Daifuku also introduced me to TypeScript, and I got to architect 2 progressive web apps utilizing Angular. While creating these PWAs, I did a lot of research
                    on web development, modern features of the web, and Angular! I took it upon myself to take what I was working on and make the apps into PWAs, and implemented
                    features that are very beneficial to the products I was developing. This introduced me Service Workers, web app manifests, Web Workers, and other PWA concepts.
                    I started teaching myself JavaScript while still at EMU, and this continued into my position at Daifuku where I work on the entire stack.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Rocket HQ helped me further improve my web development skills as I applied what I knew about Angular to their web app, and I also picked up how Jasmine works 
                    for writing unit tests for the web app. When Rocket HQ got aquired by Rocket Homes, this allowed me to move over to the Android team where I got to apply my past 
                    knowledge about Android development and at the same time learn about and implement best practices for Android development. I've learned about various Jetpack
                    components, Google Play APIs, and started writing Kotlin. I'm constantly exploring for new tools I can use for Android development in my job, and continue learning 
                    everyday while I'm there!
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I think it's an important thing to keep learning whenever you have the opportunity to, and I enjoy learning about different Technologies and how to apply them!
